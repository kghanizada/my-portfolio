		<h2>Dataset</h2>Dataset

		<p>The dataset titled 'Annual Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Air Emissions Accounts' compiles annual and quarterly greenhouse gas emissions data related to economic activities across various regions, spanning the years 2010 to 2022. 
		   It provides information on greenhouse gas emissions in million metric tons of CO2 equivalent from various countries or regions and worldwide. The dataset utilizes annual source data from the System of Environmental-Economic
		   Accounts (SEEA), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) National Inventory submissions, the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), and Climate Watch, along with sub-annual 
		   data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and other economic datasets. This comprehensive dataset aids in analyzing the impact of economic activities on GHG emissions.</p>


			<h3>Proposition</h3>
			<ol>
				
				<li> Global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) air emissions experienced a notable decline in 2020, primarily due to the unprecedented global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which included lockdowns and a temporary halt in many 
					 economic activities. </li>
			
			</ol>

			<h2>Visualization 1</h2>

				<figcaption> Design Decisions & Rational
					
					<ol>
						<li>Red Color for 2020 Data Point
							<p>Score: -1 (slightly deceptive)</p>
				        	<p>Using a distinct red color for the 2020 data point draws immediate attention to this year as an outlier. It visually separates 2020 from the rest of the data, suggesting a change, which is aligned with the 
					        narrative of a significant drop due to the pandemic. While red is often associated with danger or urgency, it's a common practice to highlight significant data points, hence the -1 score.</p>
						</li>
				
					<li>Annotation Explaining the Drop
					<p>Score: 1 (earnest)</p>
					<p>The annotation provides context for the data, informing viewers about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emissions. This helps understand the reasons behind the drop, making the visualization more
						informative and truthful to the data's story.</p>
					</li>
			
				    <li>Sharp Line Drop Representation
					<p>Score: -0.5 (slightly deceptive)</p>	
					<p>The sharp drop in the line graph emphasizes the change between 2019 and 2020. It could overstate the impact if viewers don't notice the scale on the Y-axis. The choice to make the decline sharp rather than 
					   gradual could lead viewers to think the change is more abrupt than it might have been over the course of the year.

			<h2>Visualization 2 </h2>
			<figure>
				<img 
				class="fit-picture"
				src="Fig 2.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption> Design Decisions & Rational
					
					
				<ol>
					<li>Calculated Fields for Averages
				<p>Score: -1 (slightly deceptive)</p>	
				<p>Rationale: Creating calculated fields for average emissions pre-2020, in 2020, and post-2020 simplifies the data and helps frame the 2020 drop as a mere deviation within the broader context. This design decision
					could be considered slightly deceptive because it focuses on averages, which can obscure the actual emissions range each year. It downplays the significance of the drop by integrating it into a broader average.</p>
					</li>

				<li>Inset Line Graph
				<p>	Score: -1.5 (deceptively earnest)</p>
				<p>Rationale: The inset line graph provides a longer-term perspective, illustrating that the 2020 emissions drop is less pronounced when viewed in the context of emissions over a decade. The use of this graph leans 
				   towards deceptive because it is intended to minimize the perceived impact of the 2020 drop, suggesting continuity in the long-term trend. However, it doesn't fabricate data, hence the 'earnest' aspect; it uses
				   a genuine data trend to influence perception.</p>	
				</li>

				<li>Title Framing
				<p>Score: -1 (slightly deceptive)</p>	
				<p>Rationale: The title "2020 World GHG Air Emissions Accounts Dip: A Temporary Deviation in a Persistent Upward Trend" suggests that the 2020 event is an anomaly rather than a sustained shift, influencing viewers 
				   to consider the drop as insignificant. While it doesn't mislead about the facts, it frames the narrative to minimize the perception of change.
					</p>
                </li>

				<li>
				<p>Bar Chart Scale</p>
				<p>Score: -1 (slightly deceptive)</p>
				<p>Rationale: If the bar chart uses a Y-axis scale that minimizes the apparent differences between the years, it may lead viewers to underappreciate the magnitude of the drop. This technique is common but can
				   influence the narrative by reducing the visual impact of the 2020 decrease.</p>
				</li>

			<h2>Reflection</h2>

			<p>
			Reflecting on the design process for both of these visualizations showed me the complex interplay between the objective presentation of data and the subjective art of storytelling through data and data visualization. 
			Since I had some experience in Tableau and data exploration from the previous assignments, it was straightforward to explore the data through several initial analysis and visualizations. There were some challenges with 
			data transformation and visualizations such as learning how to pivot the data since I chose to use the climate change dataset as well as using a calculated data field. Additionally, the challenge and nuance lay in the 
			subtleties of design decisions that communicate a narrative, highlight specific data points, or contextualize yearly data within longer trends.
			</p>

			<p>
			The first visualization, intended to emphasize the significance of the 2020 GHG emissions drop, was about harnessing the power of color, annotations, and stark contrasts to draw attention to a pivotal moment. The second
			visualization's goal was the antithesis, employing averages and long-term trends to downplay the same event. This duality underscored the dichotomy that exists within data visualization—where every choice has the potential
			to persuade or dissuade, to reveal or to obscure. What was surprising was how even the most earnest decisions, aimed at clarity, could inadvertently carry persuasive weight. For example, the use of a calculated field for
			averaging emissions was an earnest attempt at simplification, but it also smoothed out variances that could have been pivotal to a different narrative.
			</p>

			<p>“Ethical analysis and visualization” is a commitment to transparency, context, and intent. Ethical visualizations should provide the viewer with the necessary context to understand the data and the narrative without 
				resorting to distortion. The designers of the visualizations should strive to be transparent about the methodologies and transformations applied to the data. This process has highlighted that "acceptable" persuasive 
				choices are those that aim to clarify, not confuse; to inform, not deceive. They should invite scrutiny and stand robust against it.
			</p>

			<p>Distinguishing “acceptable” persuasive choices from “misleading” ones boils down to the intent behind the visualization and the effect it has on the viewer’s understanding. Acceptable persuasion guides the viewer to
			   insights drawn from honest data representations; misleading ones manipulate perception to preordained conclusions, possibly at the expense of the truth. The bounds here are subjective and closely tied to the data
			   visualizer's moral compass—how they interpret their role either as a neutral reporter or as an advocate with a message. In either case, the power of visualized data should be handled with respect and transparency for 
			   its potential impact.
