			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>
		
		<h2>Dataset</h2>Dataset

		<p>Every decade, the Census Bureau conducts a comprehensive survey to record the demographic composition of the United States, which significantly impacts various aspects ranging from congressional redistricting to 
		   the allocation of social services. This dataset presents a condensed overview of census data spanning two centuries, specifically 1900 and 2000. The dataset outlines the population of the United States based on 
		   the year of survey, gender, age groups (segmented into 5-year intervals from 0-4 years old to 90+ years old), and the total population count within each group. With 38 data points recorded per year, the dataset 
		   comprises a total of 76 data points. </p>


			<h3>Overall Analysis Question</h3>
			<ol>
				
				<li> How has the distribution of population across different age groups changed from 1900 to 2000 in the United States, broken down by sex? </li>
			
			</ol>

			<h2>Sketch 1 </h2>
			<figure>

				<img 
				class="fit-picture"
				src="Fig 1.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Rationale: I chose a combination of a line and bar chart because this design facilitates comparison, especially since I wanted to compare 1900 to 2000 and distinguish between males and females within
					their respective age groups. Therefore, I used diagonal lines to fill the box that showed the female population, aiming to distinguish between male and female populations within each age group.

					<p>Motivation: My goal was to illustrate the overall population structure, identifying potential shifts in age demographics for both males and females between 1900 and 2000. I hoped that this sketch could 
					effectively communicate and provide an answer to my question about how the distribution of the population across different age groups changed from 1900 to 2000 in the United States, broken down by sex.</p>
					
				<p>Strength & Weakness: This sketch allows for direct comparison between years, females, and males, potentially highlighting any gender disparities within age groups. However, it doesn’t reveal trends 
					within age groups, and with many bars and diagonal line hatches, it can be visually overwhelming. For my next sketch, I would like to explore a different way to visualize the data. Perhaps a simplified 
					version of this chart would be more visually appealing while still containing all the necessary data points to answer the question posed above.</p>

				<img 
				class="fit-picture"

				<figcaption>
					Rationale: I chose a stacked bar chart for easy comparison of population counts across age groups. I utilized filled and empty segments within the bars to differentiate between female and male populations.

					<p>Motivation: My goal was to highlight the age distribution across the 1900 and 2000 populations, with a specific interest in showing any potential gender disparities across age groups. I was hoping that this 
					stacked bar chart could effectively communicate and provide a clearer answer to the question of how the distribution of population across different age groups in 1900 in the United States is broken down by sex.</p>
					
					<p>Strengths & Weaknesses: This sketch is easier to understand than the first one; it is simple and easy on the eyes with not much going on. This chart allows for some comparison of male vs. female populations 
					within each age group in both 1900 and 2000 side by side. One can clearly see that the population in 2000 has increased compared to 1900. However, with many bars, visual differentiation between segments might
					be challenging. For my next sketch, I would like to use a population pyramid chart to better compare the distribution of males and females in the years 1900 and 2000 within different age groups.</p>
				</figcaption>

				<img 
				class="fit-picture"
				src="Fig 3.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Rationale: I chose a combination of a population pyramid chart and a line graph, which is a common way to visualize the age and sex structure of a population. The chart has the year 1900 on the left and 2000 on 
					the right. Dark blue represents females, while light blue represents males. I avoided using stereotypical colors such as pink and blue to differentiate between male and female. The male population is displayed on
					the left, and the female population on the right, with the x-axis representing population size and the y-axis representing age groups.

				<p>Motivation: My goal was to clearly illustrate the age structure of the U.S. population in both years, highlighting the distribution of males and females across different age groups. I hoped that this graph would 
					provide a better answer and understanding to the question of how the distribution of population across different age groups changed from 1900 to 2000 in the United States, broken down by sex.</p>
					
				<p>Strengths & Weaknesses: This sketch effectively highlights the age structure of the population in 1900 and 2000, with a clear distinction between males and females. The pyramid shape is visually intuitive and can 
					reveal potential imbalances in the age distribution, such as a wider base indicating a larger younger population. This also facilitates comparing both years side by side, as one can observe an increase in the 
					population in 2000, with the female population being larger than the male. However, it may look unconventional, and some people might not be able to interpret it quickly. It might not be as intuitive for some to 
					understand that the population increased in 2000 since age is on the vertical axis and population on the horizontal axis. For my next visualizations, since it will be digital, I would like to further explore 
					stacked bar charts. Perhaps I could stack the years on top of each other rather than next to each other to make it clearer for people to understand. I could also use color to differentiate between females and males.</p>

			<h2>Reflection</h2>

			<p>
			While all three sketches aimed to address the question of "How has the distribution of population across different age groups changed from 1900 to 2000 in the United States, broken down by sex?", each offered a unique perspective
			with its own set of strengths and weaknesses. The initial bar chart excelled at comparing population counts across age groups but suffered from visual clutter and lacked the ability to analyze trends. The stacked bar chart, while 
			visually easier to comprehend compared to the bar chart, still made it challenging to distinguish between the different years. The combined population pyramid and line graph was effective in comparing both years and sexes with color
			coding. However, it appeared unconventional and might not be as intuitive for some people to understand that the population increased in the year 2000. In contrast, a stacked bar chart is easy on the eyes and simpler to interpret
			since it portrays the population on the vertical axis and age on the horizontal axis.

			<h2>Phase Two: Final Design</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Question</h3>

			</ol>

				I chose a stacked bar chart as it seemed to be an appropriate choice for this visualization because it allows us to see the distribution of the population for each sex within each age group, thus providing an answer to my question:
				How has the distribution of population across different age groups changed from 1900 to 2000 in the United States, broken down by sex? I also chose this chart based on my previous exploration of stacked charts in my hand-drawn sketches.
				I conducted an experiment where I showed the three hand-drawn charts to my friends, and they all seemed to understand the stacked chart much better than the line and bar chart and the line and population pyramid chart. The stacked chart
				communicated the data in a simpler way than the other two graphs. However, I did receive a critique that it was hard to distinguish the years in the chart. 
				
				<p>Therefore, I chose to create this visualization in Tableau and stack the years 
				on top of one another rather than side by side. To be able to do this, I used "Create Calculated Field" to create fields for the year 1900 and year 2000. In this stacked bar chart, the x-axis represents age group, and the y-axis represents
				the sum of the population. Each bar is divided into two sections, one for each sex, with the height of each section representing the portion of the population for that sex in that age group. Color is used to distinguish between the two 
				sexes (male and female). This allows viewers to easily see the distribution of the population for each sex within each age group. I did choose two different shades of blue instead of stereotypical colors like pink and blue assigned to male 
				and female. I also had to change the data source for sex from 1 and 2 to male and female people can better understand what the data is representing. I wanted this visualization to be inclusive even though it was hard since the data was 
				strictly binary for sex. The x-axis is labeled "Age," and the y-axis is labeled based on the years "Year 1900" and “Year 2000”. A legend is included to explain the meaning of the colors used for each sex; dark blue shows male and light 
				blue shows female. The title of the visualization is "U.S. Population by Age Group and Sex, 1900 vs. 2000".</p>

				<p>The stacked bar chart effectively shows the composition of the population across different age groups and sexes for each year. By stacking the bars for each sex on top of each other, viewers can easily compare the distribution of the 
				population for each sex within each age group. The color coding and legend further enhance clarity by visually differentiating the sexes. Some of the observations I have already been able to make through this visualization are that there 
				was a huge increase in population between 1900 and 2000, with the population in the year 1900 being around 8M while the population for the year 2000 reached beyond 20M. One can also see that there is a higher population of females that 
				age longer than males across both years. It also shows that the population of females is much larger than the population of males in the year 2000 than in the year 1900. At the sametime, I acknowledge that stacked bar charts can be difficult
				to interpret when there are a large number of categories or when the data values vary greatly between categories. In this visualization, the large number of age groups may make it difficult to see the details for each age group, especially
				for the younger and older age groups.</p>

			<h2>Reflection: How Phase One Informed the Design</h2>

			<p>
				The sketches from phase one helped me understand the data much better. By trying to visualize them by hand, I had to deepen my understanding of the dataset. The different sketches also solidified the concept of visualizing the data by age groups
				and sex, as well as what is the best way to compare 1900 to 2000. They also contributed to exploring color usage for differentiation. It was also helpful that I was restricted to 3 hand-drawn sketches with sharpies, so I couldn’t erase anything 
				but also provided me with a lot of time to explore the possibilities for the three sketches rather than if there were many sketches. It was also helpful to get feedback on the hand-drawn sketches before working on it digitally. Since most of my 
				friends chose the stacked bar chart amongst the three visualizations I showed them, I chose to create the stacked bar chart digitally as well. Their feedback of what worked and what didn’t work helped me separate the years from being side by side 
				to being on top of one another for better clarity.
